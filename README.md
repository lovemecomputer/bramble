Heavily in alpha. Approaching a point of testing, feedback, and input if you would like to get involved.

A native desktop app running in Electron. Started from this boilerplate: https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate

---

#### Running in dev mode:

This starts the renderer process in hot-module-replacement mode and starts a server sends hot updates to the renderer process (seems like this only needs to be run once?):

`$ npm run dev`

Run these two commands simultaneously in different console tabs to initiate dev rendering & hot-swap:

- `$ npm run hot-updates-server`

- `$ npm run start-hot-renderer`
